      "Lennart is a versatile, honest and expert Senior developer. He has very strong communication skills, both internally and externally, he knows how to peel the work/assignment apart very well and explain it clearly. Guiding others comes naturally to him very well. He also has a good view of the entire playing field of a company and likes to think along, which makes him different from others and is of enormous added value. Furthermore, Lennart is very easy and pleasant to deal with, which is also not unimportant. In short, I wish every company a Lennart!",

      "Lennart is pragmatic and result driven. Fun to work with, easy to connect with both personally and professionally. During his work at Ciphix Lennart developed both technical and leadership skills. Lennart is strong technically, but also able to present ideas to internal team members and clients. Iâ€™d say any company should feel lucky having Lennart on-board.",

In his role as a senior front-end developer, Lennart has taken our React codebases to the next level with his in-depth knowledge and experience by adding more structure. Lennart is not only an expert in his field, but also a colleague with whom it is a pleasure to work. His clear communication and positive contribution have significantly strengthened the team. I am confident that Lennart will be a valuable asset wherever he goes.",

      "I worked closely with Lennart for two years. During that time he was able to teach me a lot about React. When it comes to React, Lennart is highly recommended. Thanks to his help, our own React codebases are well structured. This way, future juniors can also properly maintain and understand the databases. Lennart is a great teacher, he takes you as a person into account, improves your self-confidence and always finds a way to convey information well and logically. Thanks to his wealth of knowledge, fun and patient character, he knows how to give others self-confidence and provide them with the necessary knowledge. Lennart is a nice, smart and wonderful man and will be a great asset wherever he works.",
